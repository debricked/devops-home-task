## Introduction

This is the base for Debricked's DevOps home task.
It provides a tiny Node.js web application with an equally tiny test suite.

## How to run the tests

Install all dependencies using `npm install`.

Run `npm test` to execute the test suite.

To do this locally, you need Node.js installed on your local machine. It is known to work with both Node 16 and Node 18.

## How to run the server

Install dependencies with `npm install`, and then run the server with `node app.js`.

If you only want to run the server, without tests, you can also run `npm install --omit=dev` to avoid installing development dependencies.
